//There are four crystals below. 
//Random number will be given at the start of the game.
//Each crystal needs to have a random number between 1-10.
//By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
//The total score should equal to 51.
//If total score is greater than 51,  then we decrement a loss counter.
//If it equals to 51, then you increment a win counter.
